## Day 02

__20.05.16 Architecture for Longevity__

The priority topic of HOTEL HOUSE HOME - is the lack of specialised housing offering intuitive and inspiring design for groups of people with disabilities and the elderly. A Russian-British round table "Architecture for Longevity" was dedicated to search for solutions to this pressing issue and raised questions of design and development of homes for the elderly and people with disabilities.
The round table was attended by:
 - Leading architects from the United Kingdom, specialising in designing housing for the elderly and people with disabilities;
 - Representatives of UK housing associations involved in the development and construction of specialised housing for the elderly in the UK;
 - Representatives of leading developers and operators of social housing in the UK.

Participants from the Russian side included representatives of the Moscow City Government, architects, operators of private care homes/hotels in Russia, developers and investors. The discussion was moderated by Mariano Cavaleri (architectural practice Cavaleri Partnership, Cambridge).
Coordinator of the Russian-British Round Table - Ksenia Afonina, president of the Cambridge Russian-Speaking Society - a charity promoting Russian-British cultural projects and exchanges.
Another strand of the HOTEL HOUSE HOME project – is targeting different types of properties with specialised architecture and interior design solutions to meet the needs of certain user groups through better understanding of their lifestyle and aspirations.


## Day 03
__21.05.16 Where and how should student reside__

The project discussed such issues as the lagging supply in design and construction (renovation) of housing for young people and students. This and other challenging questions was addressed at an international forum "Where and how to live for a student?", which will brought together leading architects, developers and investors to share their experience in design, construction and operation of student dormitories, apartments for extended stays, and hotels for young people. "Student accommodation" – is a modern product, which is different from a budget hotel and combines elements of conventional student dormitory with those of a fashionable and comfortable living space for students, as well as for travellers. The forum discussed ways of combining the needs of different user groups, while avoiding compromises in comfort, convenience and efficiency; exchange knowledge and solutions developed in different European countries and analyse the prospects for their application in Russia. 
The Forum welcomed the following participants: Povl-Filip Sonne Frederiksen, Mariano Cavaleri (architectural practice Cavaleri Partnership, Cambridge), Rector of the Moscow Architectural Institute - D.O. Shvidkovskiy, Head of „East Development“ Group of Companies - S.N. Ivantsov.
