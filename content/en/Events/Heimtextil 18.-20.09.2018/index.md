Heimtextil Russia is the main trade fair for home and interior textiles in Russia. This year it took place at IEC Crocus Expo. Heimtextil Russia is a trend barometer for world textile trends, a central business platform for the textile industry and, of course, the best collections of textiles for homes, hotels, restaurants, offices, and other premises.

## Concept
The program of events of Hotel House Home concentrates on specific features and problems of design and building of hotels, apartments, and specialized housing.

## Goal
 - Fill the information vacuum; systematize communication between architects, designers, hotel operators, and developers.
 - Outline the prospects for aesthetic and ecological formation of the living environment, including the development of services in the design and construction of hotels and specialized housing for the near future.

## Specificity
A distinctive feature of the project is the creation of an artistic environment for communication between architects and designers: hosting international conferences, round tables, and master classes for the exchange of experience and demonstration of best practices in this field.

World-class architects and designers, as well as companies considered experts in hotel and apartment construction and furnishing (including student housing, hostels, and specialized accommodation for disabled and elderly persons), are attracted to the events.

In parallel, the project Hotel House Home presents comprehensive solutions offered by leading suppliers of equipment, furniture, decoration materials, and interior accessories.

In 2018, Hotel House Home was held within the exhibition Heimtextil Russia from 18 to 20 September in Moscow, Crocus Expo IEC. The program included a wide range of events for all categories of participants and visitors: congresses and conferences, round tables and discussion clubs, lectures, and master classes.

### Theme of the project Hotel House Home – “12 chairs.”
Under the title “Textile Design”, they form the world‘s largest platform of their kind. Digital printer manufacturers and Heimtextil‘s newly designed trend area also find their home here. Heimtextil thus brings together the progressive themes of textile design, digital printing, and trends over one hall level.

## Wall Decoration
Wallpaper manufacturers presented their wares in the Mockup room, showcasing a unique range of wallpapers and wall coverings under the title “Wall Decoration.” With its clear product focus, the segment with numerous international industry leaders could be expanded in an even more attractive manner.

## Decorative & Furniture Fabrics
Manufacturers of upholstery and decorative fabrics, leather, and imitation leather came together as part of the “Decorative & Furniture Fabrics” segment – integrated into our project “12 chairs.” This segment includes the world‘s largest range of upholstery and decorative fabrics, as well as upholstery leather and imitation leather.

The HHH Hall continued to develop into a meeting point for architects, interior designers, and hotel furnishers. Manufacturers with extensive experience in contract furnishing could present themselves here. Another highlight was “Interior.Architecture.Hospitality,” the exclusive exhibition format especially for the contract industry, featuring product presentations, lectures, and round tables.

## Window & Interior Decoration
Exhibitors in the HHH section presented curtains, decorative fabrics, carpets, sun protection, and decoration systems in the Mockup room, under the title “Window & Interior Decoration.”

## Beautiful Living
Suppliers of decorative cushions, blankets, plaids, and table and kitchen linen found suitable surroundings in the HHH Hall.
