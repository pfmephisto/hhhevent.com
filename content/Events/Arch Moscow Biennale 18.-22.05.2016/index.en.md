__19.05.16__

As part of the HOTEL HOUSE HOME forum, the exhibition "Focusing on Hotel" introduced ARCH Moscow visitors to mock-ups of standard hotel rooms, including one created for "Holiday Inn" as part of the renovation of the "HI Sokolniki" hotel. These models reflect the latest standards for designing 3-star and 5-star hotels.

Exhibitors included manufacturers of specialized furnishings, decorative materials, flooring, furniture, technical and decorative lighting, and plumbing fixtures.

A roundtable discussion focused on hotel design brought together international hotel operators, developers, and leading Russian and foreign architects and designers. Participants included:

 - Maria Sonne-Frederiksen – MSF Architecture, Architektenkammer BDA Hannover
 - Natalia Aristova – Design Director for Russia, CIS, Baltics & Scandinavia at IHG
 - Ksenia Speranskaja – Translator
 - Mariano Cavaleri – Cavaleri Partnership, Cambridge
 - Tatjana Smotrjaeva – Deputy General Director, HI Sokolniki

## Day 02 – Architecture for Longevity_
__20.05.16__

A key topic of the HOTEL HOUSE HOME forum was the shortage of specialized housing with intuitive and inspiring design for people with disabilities and the elderly. The Russian–British roundtable "Architecture for Longevity" focused on identifying architectural solutions to address this issue. The discussion covered the design and development of housing tailored to these populations.

Participants included:
 - Leading architects from the United Kingdom specializing in housing for elderly and disabled people
 - Representatives from UK housing associations involved in the development and construction of such housing
 - Representatives from major UK developers and social housing operators

From the Russian side, the roundtable welcomed representatives from the Moscow City Government, architects, developers, investors, and private care home operators.

The discussion was moderated by Mariano Cavaleri (Cavaleri Partnership, Cambridge).
The roundtable was coordinated by Ksenia Afonina, President of the Cambridge Russian-Speaking Society, a charity supporting Russian–British cultural exchanges and projects.

Another direction of the HOTEL HOUSE HOME initiative is to identify target user groups for various types of real estate and to develop architectural and interior design solutions based on a deeper understanding of their lifestyle and needs.


## Day 03 – Where and How Should Students Reside
__21.05.16__

This session of the HOTEL HOUSE HOME project addressed the critical shortage in the design and construction (or renovation) of housing for young people and students. These topics were the focus of the international forum "Where and How Should Students Live?", which brought together leading architects, developers, and investors to exchange insights on the planning, construction, and operation of:

 - Student dormitories
 - Extended-stay apartments
 - Youth hotels

Student accommodation is a modern housing product distinct from budget hotels. It combines elements of traditional student dormitories with the comfort and aesthetic of contemporary living spaces—catering not only to students but also to young travelers. The forum examined how to meet the needs of various user groups without compromising on comfort, convenience, or efficiency. It also explored how successful solutions from European countries might be adapted for the Russian context.

Forum participants included:
 - Povl Filip Sonne-Frederiksen
 - Mariano Cavaleri – Cavaleri Partnership, Cambridge
 - D.O. Shvidkovskiy – Rector, Moscow Architectural Institute
 - S.N. Ivantsov – Head of the East Development Group of Companies

Event Moderator: Marina Usenko – Independent consultant in the hospitality industry

### Student Competition
To apply these concepts in practice, an international student competition was launched to design a modern apartment layout for the House of the Architect Student, located in Moscow.

Architecture students were invited to develop a prototype apartment that met contemporary requirements for student living, while working within the spatial and structural constraints of the building constructed in 1968. The layout had to include areas for work, rest, and social interaction.

The competition ran from February 15 to April 15, 2016. The winning entries were announced and presented during the HOTEL HOUSE HOME project at ARCH Moscow.

Jury members included:
 - D.O. Shvidkovskiy (Chair) – Rector of the Moscow Architectural Institute
 - V. Bychkov (Deputy Chair) – Organizer of the ARCH Moscow exhibition
 - Maria Sonne-Frederiksen – Architect
 - Sergey Ivantsov – Head of the East Development Group of Companies
 - Ruben Arakelyan – Architect
 - Mariano Cavaleri – Cavaleri Partnership, Cambridge
 - Anna Flank – Editor, ELITE Interior

The top three projects were awarded diplomas and prizes.
Competition Coordinators: Povl Filip Sonne-Frederiksen and Sonia Bychkova
