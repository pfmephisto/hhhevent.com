In 2018, the Hotel House Home project took place within the Batimat Russia exhibition from 3–6 April in Moscow, at Crocus Expo IEC.
Batimat Russia is the country’s leading architecture and construction exhibition, where top Russian and European designers and architects present modern building technologies and materials, interior trends, and new collections from major manufacturers of building and finishing materials and equipment.

The expanded 2018 exposition showcased leading global brands in sanitary ware and ceramics, unique concepts for creating interior spaces, and trends in the construction industry. The program included a wide range of events for all categories of participants and visitors: congresses and conferences, round tables and discussion clubs, lectures, and master classes. The traditional competitions Batimat Inside and Innovation were also part of the program.

Following the results of 2017, Batimat Russia became the most visited exhibition venue in Russia, confirming its strong development potential and the relevance of its topics.

## Exhibition

“Apartments of the Future. Innovative Materials and Technologies” was the theme of the 2018 project. To immerse visitors in the topic, MSF designers (Germany) created a model hotel apartment with several installations: a bedroom, a bathroom, and a children’s corner. The central area hosted conversations, conferences, and round tables — the business agenda was, as always, intensive.
